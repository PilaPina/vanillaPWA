#This is your Vanilla PWA Workshop !

This is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript file.  <br>
You are going to change it into an  all powerful installable and offline-browsable PWA!! 

We are going to create a web manifest, hire a service worker and register them to our payroll. And then we are going to give them the job of caching our assets so we can look at our pretty page even though we don't have any internet. And then we will have our trusty dev tools see if the worker is doing their job. 

1. create a manifest
2. create a service worker file where the job is defined. <br>
We want them to cache assets, handle the installation and serve the cached assets when there is not network. 
3. register the service worker
4. inspect and see if the job is done
